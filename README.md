# Optimal Execution by Homotopy Analysis Method

This is a short research project implementation on optimal execution via homotopy analysis method (HAM). The HAM algorithm shown in this repo is motivated by the paper, [Optimal execution with nonlinear transient market impact](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4839), by Gianbiagio Curato, Jim Gatheral, and Fabrizio Lillo. The corresponding course is ACTSC972 (Finance III) instructed by Alexander Schied.
